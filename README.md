# Web server test with weather app

[This Project](https://mariani-weather-app.herokuapp.com/) is a test of how to create a web-server with Express and Node. I made this project using express to manage the server, heroku to deploy it and handlebars to make it easier the use of dynamic data. I also integrated the possibility of having nodemon as a devDependencies to make it easier to updte data as it gets modified during developments of the app.

## Instruction

1. Make sure that Node and Npm are installed on your machine to run the program on your local machine
2. Create a local file of the project 
3. Enter the file via terminal `cd web-server-test`
4. To run the application on your localhost run `npm run start`
5. Now visit on your browser http://localhost:3000

## Build with
- Node.js
- Weatherstack API
- Npm request package
- Heroku
